## Technologies Used

This Donation DApp is built using the following technologies:

- **Vite**: Vite is a fast build tool that significantly speeds up the development process by leveraging native ES Module imports. It provides lightning-fast cold server start and hot module replacement (HMR) during development.
  
- **React**: React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It enables developers to create interactive UI components efficiently and manage state effectively using its component-based architecture.

- **npm**: npm is the package manager for Node.js and JavaScript. It is used to install, share, and manage dependencies for this project.
